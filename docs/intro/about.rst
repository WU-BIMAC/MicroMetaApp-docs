What is Micro-Meta App?
=======================
**Micro-Meta App is an easy to use and flexible software for the collection of Microscopy Metadata.**

Micro-Meta App collects Microscopy Hardware, Imaging Acquisition Settings, and Quality Control metadata on the basis of the `4DN Nucleome-BINA Microscopy Metadata Guidelines <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370>`_ which are an extension of the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_ and have been developed in the context of the `4D Nucleome (4DN) initiative <https://www.4dnucleome.org/>`_ and the `Bioimaging North America <https://www.bioimagingna.org>`_ `Quality Control and Data Management Working Group <https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg>`_

*****************
Features include:
*****************
* Intuitive graphical user interface metadata collection modality
* Compatibility with the `4DN Nucleome-BINA Microscopy Metadata Guidelines <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370>`_ extension of the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_
* Storage of Microscope Hardware specifications metadata in re-usable  JSON files that can be exchanged with other members of the community
* Easy to use as a standalone app
* Easy to integrate into pre-existing repositories
* Pilot integration into the popular OMERO image data repository

****************
Implementations:
****************
Currently, three implementations of the Micro-Meta App are available on Github.

1. A `standalone version <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/4DNMicroscopyMetadataToolReactElectron>`_ implemented in Javascript Electron.
2. A `Javascript React <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/4DNMicroscopyMetadataToolReact>`_ version that can be integrated into any web portal, such as the 4DN Data Portal.
3. An `OMERO plugin <https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/4DNMicroscopyMetadataToolOmero>`_ version that is only available as a pilot implementation on the UMMS-PMM instance of the OMERO server.
