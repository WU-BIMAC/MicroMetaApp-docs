What is Micro-Meta App?
***********************

**Micro-Meta App is a open source software for the collection of Microscopy Metadata.**

Micro-Meta App collects Microscopy Hardware, Imaging Acquisition Settings and Quality Control metadata on the basis of the `4DN Nucleome-BINA Microscopy Metadata Guidelines <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370>`_ which are an extension of the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_ and have been developed in the context of the `4D Nucleome (4DN) initiative <https://www.4dnucleome.org/>`_ and the `Bioimaging North America <https://www.bioimagingna.org>`_ `Quality Control and Data Management Working Group <https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg>`_

Features include:

* Intuitive graphical user interface metadata collection modality
* Compatibility with the `OME data model <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.1/developers/model-overview.html>`_
* Definition of Microscope Hardware specifications metadata to build re-usable Microscope JSON files that can be exchanged with other members of the community
* Easy to use as standalone app
* Easy to integrate into pre-existing repositories
* Pilot integration into the popular OMERO image data repository
