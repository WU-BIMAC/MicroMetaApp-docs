Micro-Meta App could not have been developed without the help of multiple individuals, whose contribution we would like to acknowledge here: Mathias Hammer, Maximiliaan Huisman, Farzin Farzam and David Grunwald of the University of Massachusetts Medical School provided inspiration, many useful suggestions, continual support to the project and did lots of the initial testing; Burak Alver, Alexander Balashov, Shannon Ehmsen, Koray Kirli, and Peter Park, from Harvard Medical School were instrumental throughout the project for the development of the graphical user interface, software testing, and backend integration in the 4DN Data Portal. Will Moore was very generous with his time for the initial development of the Micro-Meta App OMERO plugin.
