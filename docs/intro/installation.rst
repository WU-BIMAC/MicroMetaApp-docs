  * Open the ``left-click menu`` and select the ``Open`` command.
  * In case you receive an error message the first time you launch ``micro-meta-app-electron.app``, please click ``OK`` and launch again using the ``left-click menu``.
  * The second time you launch, you might be given a warning about opening an app from an unknown developer, in that case please select ``Open`` to continue.
