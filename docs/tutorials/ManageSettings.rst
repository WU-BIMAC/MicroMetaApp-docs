B. Managing Microscope Specification files
******************************************
Please follow these step by step instructions.

B.1 Selecting Tier level
========================
Click on the "Tier" selector and select the Tier level you are interested in and click on “Manage Settings”.

.. tip::

  Please note that a Settings metadata file that has been opened at a given Tier level can be validated and saved at a lower level, thus facilitating the work required for full documentation by allowing it to be done over multiple sessions.

There are two options for doing: “Load from file” allows to import a Microscope file that has not been loaded in the App yet (i.e., a Microscope file you might have received from someone else). “Load from repository” allows to open a Microscope file that has already been imported in the App.

B.2.1 Loading from file
-----------------------
After selecting “Load from file”, click on "Select an existing Microscope file you want to work on.", select the desired Microscope file (e.g., one that you might have received from a colleague) , click “Open” and then hit “Continue”.

B.5 Working on a Settings file
==============================
After opening a new or an existing Settings file, the application will display the main Mananage Settings canvas, which allows to enter or edit metadata values pertaining to different aspects of Image Acquisition.
